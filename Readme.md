Use this REST api for getting the results: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments

Create a simple one screen application with scrollable table view.

Display REST api results in table view - cell should contain information from json response.

Tapping on cell opens dialog showing the same data.

Please use paging to make sure that loading and scrolling is smooth (load while scrolling is preferred).

Use Room or ORM of your choice for persisting data for offline use.

Add pull to refresh action to the table view.

Please make sure to prepare the app in a way which makes it simple to add features.

Prepare the app for 3 environments (dev, staging and prod) - you can use the same url for all three, this is not important.

Make sure that you use the Material Design UI.

Add unit tests.
